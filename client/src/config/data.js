      "Google has agreed to pay $118 million to settle a class action lawsuit that alleges the company underpaid female employees. The agreement will release Google from claims that it paid women in Covered Positions less than it paid men for substantially similar work, that Google assigned women to lower levels than it assigned men, and that Google failed to pay all wages due to employees upon their separation of employment the settlement says.The settlement covers about 15,500 women who have worked for Google in California since 2013, the plaintiffs' law firm said in an announcement on Saturday. Four named plaintiffs will get separate payouts: $75,000 for lead plaintiff Kelly Ellis and $50,000 each for the other three, in addition to their regular share from the net settlement fund. The settlement class covers a wide range of workers with 236 job titles.",

    description:
      "In August 1917, a World War I British soldier named John Glubb was hit in the face by a shell. He recalled blood pouring out in torrents and feeling something akin to a chicken bone moving around his left cheek. It turned out to be half of his jaw, broken off by the impact.Glubb wasn't the only unfortunate WWI soldier to suffer a disfiguring facial injury. Shells filled with shrapnel were designed to inflict as much damage as possible, and the need to peer over the parapets of trenches to assess the battlefield or fire a shot meant a greater risk of getting hit in the face by bits of flying metal. Unlike losing a limb, these soldiers faced great social and professional stigmas when they returned home from the front because of their disfigurement. They were usually reduced to taking night shifts and relegated to special blue benches when out in public—a warning to others to avert their eyes.",

    title: 'Astra rocket’s second stage fails, NASA CubeSats lost',
    category: 'science',
    description:
     "On Sunday, the launch of two CubeSats on an Astra rocket failed to go as planned, with the rocket's second stage cutting out prematurely. The loss cost NASA two CubeSats that were meant to be part of a small constellation that would track the development of tropical storms. The failure represents yet another setback for a rocket company that has emphasized rapid development and testing-by-launching.The lost CubeSats were intended to be part of a six-satellite series called TROPICS. With six satellites in three different orbital planes, TROPICS was designed to provide detailed temporal and spatial imaging of precipitation in tropical storms. NASA's statement on the loss indicates that the agency will still be able to pursue the mission with just four satellites.",

      "Major cryptocurrencies suffered big losses on Monday. As I write this, bitcoin is down 14 percent over the last 24 hours, while ether is down 16 percent. Other major cryptocurrencies—including solana, dogecoin, and litecoin—are also down by double digits, according to CoinMarketCap.The cryptocurrency crash is part of a broader market sell-off. The S&P 500 stock market index fell almost 4 percent on Monday amid fears of faster interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve. High interest rates put downward pressure on all assets, including stocks and cryptocurrencies.",

     "Development of a Meta smartwatch is on pause, Bloomberg reported Thursday, citing an anonymous person with knowledge of the matter.Facebook's parent company never confirmed it was making a smartwatch to rival the Apple Watch and Samsung's Galaxy Watch. It also declined to comment on Bloomberg's story. However, Bloomberg claimed that Meta has been working on a smartwatch, codenamed Milan, for at least two years.Bloomberg claims to have seen images and video of a Meta watch prototype that featured two cameras to compete with the Apple Watch's zero. That dual-camera design—which purportedly included one 5MP camera south of the watch face and a 12MP one on the face's backside facing the wearer's arm—was apparently part of the problem, however.",

    category: 'tech',
    description:
     "Apple's Studio Display, a 27-inch 5K IPS panel that offers USB-C connectivity, a polished finish, and some Apple-style perks, is a solid display. But what if you're a Mac owner who doesn't need 5K, or what if you don't want to spend $1,600 on a monitor? What if you need to work across operating systems and want a stylish display with a unique boost in image quality?Enter the Dell UltraSharp U2723QE ($655 MSRP as of writing). Dell's USB-C-equipped UltraSharp line is a popular option for Mac and Windows users, though the U2723QE comes at a premium over other displays in the lineup because it introduces LG Display's IPS Black technology, which aims to deliver twice as much contrast as the average IPS screen. You might not be able to tell 5K from 4K, but it's easy to see the rich contrast the U2723QE delivers over standard IPS monitors, including the Studio Display.",

    title: '"A dying star’s last hurrah". At the end of their lives, sunlike stars metamorphose into glowing shells of gas',
    category: 'science',
    description:
     "Billions of years from now, as our Sun approaches the end of its life and helium nuclei begin to fuse in its core, it will bloat dramatically and turn into what’s known as a red giant star. After swallowing Mercury, Venus, and Earth with hardly a burp, it will grow so large that it can no longer hold onto its outermost layers of gas and dust.In a glorious denouement, it will eject these layers into space to form a beautiful veil of light, which will glow like a neon sign for thousands of years before fading.The galaxy is studded with thousands of these jewel-like memorials, known as planetary nebulae. They are the normal end stage for stars that range from half the Sun’s mass up to eight times its mass. (More massive stars have a much more violent end, an explosion called a supernova.) Planetary nebulae come in a stunning variety of shapes, as suggested by names like the Southern Crab, the Cat’s Eye, and the Butterfly. But as beautiful as they are, they have also been a riddle to astronomers. How does a cosmic butterfly emerge from the seemingly featureless, round cocoon of a red giant star? Observations and computer models are now pointing to an explanation that would have seemed outlandish 30 years ago: Most red giants have a much smaller companion star hiding in their gravitational embrace. This second star shapes the transformation into a planetary nebula, much as a potter shapes a vessel on a potter’s wheel.",

   "Last month, Insomniac Games (Spider-Man) CEO Ted Price reportedly told his employees that parent company Sony will not approve ANY statements from any studio on the topic of reproductive rights.That is apparently no longer true, as Insomniac and other Sony studios have tweeted statements in support of reproductive freedom in the wake of this morning's Supreme Court decision overturning the long-standing Roe v. Wade precedent on the issue.By the afternoon, many of Sony's other North American game studios had started tweeting similar messages, including Sucker Punch (Ghost of Tsushima), Naughty Dog (The Last of Us), Santa Monica Studio (God of War), San Diego Studio (MLB: The Show), and Bend Studio (Days Gone). Some of Sony's European studios, including Media Molecule (LittleBigPlanet), Guerilla Games (Horizon), and PlayStation London Studio, have also joined in with tweeted statements of support",

    description:
     "Polestar is riding pretty high right now. Now listed on the NASDAQ exchange, the company is preparing to introduce three new electric vehicles over the next three years: a large SUV in 2023, a smaller crossover in 2024, and a flagship (read: expensive) four-door coupe in 2025. In March, the company introduced a new variant of the Polestar 2 fastback sedan, the $48,400 Polestar 2 Long Range Single motor.And after a few days of driving one, I think it's another data point in favor of the argument that less power sometimes means more fun when it comes to EVs. But I must confess I'm scratching my head about the long range part, given the useable capacity of the battery pack and the EV's energy efficiency.",
